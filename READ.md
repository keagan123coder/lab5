 Frameworks Overview
1. Bootstrap
Type: Component-based CSS framework
Key Features:
-Pre-styled UI components (navbars, cards, modals)
-Responsive grid system
-JavaScript plugins included

Experience:
Bootstrap allowed us to quickly prototype a professional-looking layout with minimal effort. The documentation was clear, though we found some limitations in customization compared to utility-first frameworks.

2. Tailwind CSS
Type: Utility-first CSS framework
Key Features:
 -Low-level utility classes for complete design control
 -Mobile-first responsive design
 -Just-in-Time compiler for optimized builds
Experience:
Tailwind's approach required more initial setup but offered superior flexibility. We particularly appreciated the responsive prefixes (like md: and lg:) that made building adaptive layouts intuitive.

3. React.js
Type: JavaScript library for building UIs
Key Features:
- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
- Hooks for state management
Experience:
React's component model made our code more organized and reusable. The useState hook simplified state management, though there was a learning curve in understanding the rendering lifecycle.
